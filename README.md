In the development  have been included such libraries:

- angular 1.2.0;
- angular-ui-router.js;
- angularLocalStorage.js;
- alertify.js;
- jQuery.js;
- bootstrap.js;
- underscore.js;

The implementation was done using routing and dynamic-loading pages, 
so for correct work of app it is necessary to open the it from server, (ex. denver or any other local server).
