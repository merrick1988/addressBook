In the development  have been included such libraries:

- angular 1.2.0;
- angular-ui-router.js;
- angularLocalStorage.js;
- alertify.js;
- jQuery.js;
- bootstrap.js;
- underscore.js;

The application was implemented using routing and dynamic-loading pages, 
thus it needs the web-server to work correctly (i.e. Apache).
